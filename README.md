Cheaply made and cheaply bought, it is meant to resemble a queenly diamond in glass and brass. A large, 3 lobed brown jewel sits beneath a crown of small, round, apricot-colored gems in a color palette that now seems a stereotype of the 1970s. These faux diamonds have been haphazardly set into a thin, metal clip that pinches and weighs the ear unpleasantly. It was presumably once part of a pair, but its twin has long ago been lost in the back of a drawer of a relative or the case of a second-hand shop or (most likely) underneath 200ft of West Seattle landfill. It is, without doubt, an object out of place. I keep it in my jewelry drawer, but I have no intention of wearing it. It has no functionalist, aesthetic, or rational role in my life and there is really no reason that I should keep it.

Yet, I cling to it: not for what it is, or what it was, or what it could be; not for its value, not for its beauty, not for the hope that I may someday wear it. I cling to it because it was hers: the property of a great aunt, Bea, now dead. I keep it because it is full of memories: the memory of childhood visits and the smell of old perfume and hospital disinfectant. The memory of a sombre distribution that I did not understand, and a jewellery box that I was too small to carry. The memory of a quiet presence, felt on the back of the neck in the superstitious hours. The memory of death and life and loss and obligation and the first thing I ever owned that glittered.

In my archaeological education, I have spent a great deal of time exploring the properties of materials. I have tried to make sense of object materiality through measurement, weight, form, wear, illustration, reconstruction, sound, smell, heft, and feel. Yet in this lump of ugly brown glass, none of these really matter. Instead, I cannot relinquish it (though I might wish to) because it is imbued with a secret materiality that exists in my mind alone. I understand and interact with this object because it is haunted: by memory, by superstition, and by a link that still connects me to a woman decades dead.

# More than the Sum of its Parts

This is the story of a material property that isn’t. It is not visible, it is not quantifiable, it isn’t even material. And yet, it is experienced (sometimes quite powerfully), and it has effects (sometimes quite dramatic)[^55]. It is the sense that objects are haunted: somehow changed by the persisting agency of the dead; by an intrusion of those gone onto the living experience of the material world, both literally and figuratively. Yet, however potent the effects may be, experiences of hauntedness are still highly personal, subjective, and individual and thus elude the project of objective realism that underpins grounded archeological study. By its affective nature, hauntedness is a sensory experience that cannot be measured, replicated, or recorded, and this makes its study resistive to traditional methods. Yet archeology is uniquely positioned to engage with these points of overlap between the objective and subjective: straddling the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. So, instead of resisting this intersection of objectivity and subjectivity, this paper seeks to engage with it directly: interweaving narrative, image production, and analysis to explore hauntedness as a property of objects. In doing so, I hope not only to define and validate hauntedness as an important aspect of object materiality, but also to encourage creative approaches to the complex, resistive, often immaterial materiality of objects.

# Hauntedness as a Material Property of Objects

To ask whether hauntedness is real is to ask the wrong question. The afterlife is a topic for philosophers, theologians, neuroscientists, and metaphysicians - and so I leave it to them. Instead, this paper approaches hauntedness through the lens of Material Culture Studies, in which material identities are co-constituted in the relationships between people and objects[^34][^36][^71]. Physical attributes and social attributes both converge in the perception of the world and reality is constructed on this intersection [^19][^24][^34][^55]. Within this frame, it doesn’t matter if the dead actually linger on the material plane. If reality is constructed around a metaphysics that includes hauntedness as a material property of the world, then individuals will interact with that world in reference to hauntedness [^28]. As such, it is real enough. The mind is not so neatly separated from the body [^47][^65]; placebos, after all, can still heal the sick [^7]. 
<param ve-image 
       label="Here, a traditional archeological illustration is posed with two hands in a posture of recoil. Though this gesture is culturally contingent, so too is the reaction of trepidation, disgust, fear, or surpirse that an object may evoke. It is a gesture that is consistant with western reactions to hauntedness." 
       description="The earring illustration was produced in a photoediting software GIMP 2.10.22, using both a manually produced illustration and a photograph as references. Hands were then traced by the author in GIMP."

Hauntedness is therefore a subjective property of object materiality. It is a property in which the dead imbue matter with agency. This agency may be physical [^3], magical [^28][^55][^75], and/or emotional[^30][^38], but it is a power that emerges from biographical associations between people and things [^34][^42]. It is a persistence of entanglement between the dead, the living, and material objects in a panoply of configurations across time and space[^30][^71].In this sense, haunted objects are a prime example of mixtures[^71] or bundles[^4]. They are both subject and object, human and nonhuman, real and unreal, effected by and effecting human consciousness, and full of contradictions and bifurcations[^71]. They make the social physical and the physical social[^4], entangling, mixing, and distributing human consciousness and object materiality[^33]. They compress and distort time and disrupt the neat separation of past, present, and future[^30][^67]. 
<param ve-image 
       label="Here, a photograph of the earring is enmeshed in a tangle of associations between past people, current people, objects, and academic persuits as a means of visualizing the earring as a node in a much broader entanglement. The images present Bea as she lived, a framed photograph of Bea, a photograph of the author now and at around the time of Bea's death, as well as models and illustrations produced over the course of this project."
       description="Images were taken from the personal collections of the author as well as the photographic collections of Bea's relatives, Bill and Marge Richie and Amy Hanson. They were then compiled in the photoediting software GIMP 2.10.22."

It is precisely because haunted objects offer such a rich and complex materiality that they are useful for engaging archaeological theory. They provide an example of object agency derived from human subjects, yet at varying levels of perceived intentionality[^4][^71]. They are vibrant matter, but it is a vibrancy that primarily springs from supernatural or affective sources as opposed to the materials of the objects themselves [^36][^55]. They are entangled, not only in “webs of life” [^37], but webs beyond life, where the dead remain entangled in the world[^74] through their objects. Objects become links in a chain to nothing that nevertheless still hold the shape of that enchainment like a phantom limb [^4][^24]. Perhaps most fascinatingly, this resistant materiality can have a material expression. Haunted objects may evoke a sensory experiences that are both powerfully perceived and culturally constituted [^3][^2][^44][^49], complicating the frame of what constitute sensory approaches in archaeology.

Yet for all that these objects can enrich explorations of object materiality, they exist on the fringe of archaeology. They are, after all, superstitious objects, displaying a materiality that exists outside the natural sciences and the objective goals of processual archaeology [^10][^19]. Haunted objects appear to embody a form of “magical” thinking that is seen as decidedly unmodern, unenlightened, uneducated, and irrational[^2][^55][^28][^75]. Hauntedness, along with magic, folklore, and superstition are therefore relegated to the outskirts of the discipline[^16][^19], or worse still, left to the purview of pseudo-archaeology in its hunt for ghosts, curses, aliens, and monsters[^9][^32][^75]. Moreover, explorations of hauntedness might appear to skirt the symbolic and psychoanalytic approaches of post-processualism, focusing on the meaning of things [^37][^38]; a particularly fraught project when no resources are available for emic analysis[^10].
<param ve-image 
       label="The classic 'bedsheet' ghost that originated from the funerary practices of the European Middle Ages[^50] is a now ubiquitous cliché of hauntedness. As such, it can act as a visual shorthand for hauntedness, such as the renderings of Egyptian Shaitan added to images of Egyptian archaeology [^33]. In this image, a ghost is produced in a purposefully cartoonish way, visually signalling its metephoric, as opposed to literal, aspect. Yet it is this very cartoonish, childish, populist representation of haunting that archeologists resist in their analysis of objects. It is therefore an image of what archeologists fear: that in exploring immaterial materialities of objects, they depart from a scientific, rational, and grounded study of the past."

This paper does not seek to embark on such a project of meaning making (much less a project of ghost hunting). This paper instead seeks to recognize hauntedness as part of the “murk[y] middle ground” in explorations of folk ritual beliefs [^10]. It is a sphere of causality that exists in tandem with objective causality[^55]. By dismissing it, we may “build false assumptions about what the ‘real world’ is like”[^28], secularizing, rationalizing, and suppressing the often powerful effects of heritage[^11][^55]. As we collect a library of sensory experience through which to examine objects [^26][^27][^35], a focus on the physical senses alone may well be inconsistent with the ontologies that framed (and frame) the experience of the material world[^11][^28]. In failing to recognize that sensory experiences may be informed by these deep spiritual, cultural frameworks, we are doomed to an idea of sensitivity that is sanitized and one-dimensional.

These creative approaches to staging, mood, evocation, etc. can allow for deeper explorations of both social and physical dimensionalities in a way that is both flexible and accessable."

# Humanist Problems Require Creative Solutions

In exploring hauntedness as an immaterial material property of objects, tools for quantification are clearly inappropriate. Indeed, attempts to measure and record evidence of ghosts and spirits quickly diverge into the realms of ghost hunting [^3], spiritualism[^2], and pseudo-archeology[^9][^32]. Instead, subjective questions require a more subjective toolkit: one that engages this subjectivity, as opposed to resisting or obscuring it[^70]. This paper deploys two such tools to explore hauntedness as a material property of objects. The first is auto-ethnographic storytelling [^3][^30][^38], and the second is visual artistic practice[^22][^30][^70]. In doing so, I seek to demonstrate the ways that creative practice can be deployed to enrich more traditional forms of analysis.

Drawing from anthropology, the use of auto-ethnographic storytelling is quite commonplace in the discipline, and has been very effectively deployed to explore affective aspects of memory [^30][^43], ruination[^60], materials [^34][^36], etc. This mode of engagement is particularly appropriate in relationship to haunting, as first-hand accounts of haunting experience are a key element of ghost belief [^3]. Moreover, ghosts and hauntings frequently appear as a conceptual metaphor in heritage study in reference to things that are abandoned, concealed, or suppressed[^2]. In the logocentric context of professional academia[^40], auto-ethnographic storytelling is the logical creative extension for archeological analysis, but this reflexivity is hardly the exclusive remit of the written word.

Image production offers a different form of storytelling, but one in which the discipline is far less comfortable[^70]. Though social sciences, and particularly anthropology, have begun experimenting with new visual modes of engagement[^29], images are often still treated with suspicion or hostility [^53][^70]. Though a visually rich discipline [^64][^70] exposed to an increasingly rich visual media landscape[^61], archeology often struggles with visual literacy[^32][^40][^59][^63][^70]. There are fears that images are overly subjective in production[^52], interpretively unstable [^40][^70][^61], and able to achieve a false sense of authority, concealing nefarious theoretical or political intentions behind pleasant aesthetics[^32][^40][^53][^54][^52]. If the visual is associated with the real and objective[^55] and archeological images are expected to present authoritative and accurate depictions of the world [^70] any deviance from realism is a necessarily a betrayal of truth.
<param ve-image

       url= https://github.com/rosemaryhanson/HansonHauntedTest2/blob/main/Collected%20Illustration2.png?raw=true> 
            
These fears are not unfounded, but stem from a foundational naiveté around what images can and can’t do[^70]. Images cannot be perfect, objective representations of an object [^64] Images and image-making are culturally, socially, and perceptually relative[^52], not to mention dependent on the skill, knowledge, and experience of the artist[^64]. Moreover, viewers will apply their own prejudices as they interpret art [^40][^70] and these will change and shift over time and context[^61]. And images cannot be innocent: they have agendas as part of their _raison d’etre_[^52][^64].

       url="https://github.com/rosemaryhanson/HansonHauntedTest2/blob/main/spotlight9.png?raw=true"> 
            
Yet each of these concerns can equally be levied at the written word: written analysis of objects is culturally contingent [^34][^73], words are frequently misinterpreted by audiences[^75], and articles are published with explicit theoretical (and implicit political) agendas. The difference here is simply one of literacy: archeologists are comfortable in textual analysis, but not in visual analysis[^32][^59]. Furthermore, these concerns over images are not without their paternalistic undertones. Images are widely popular and accessible – often more so than words[^32][^61]. If even children can see and comprehend an image[^29][^40], how then can the public be trusted to come to the “correct” conclusions?
<param ve-image

       url="https://github.com/rosemaryhanson/HansonHauntedTest2/blob/main/Word%20Cloud.png?raw=true"> 
            
Yet it is because of this very subjectivity that images can be useful to engage with more culturally contingent questions. Images facilitate the “ability to explore subjective, problematic, personal, empathic, emotional and un-quantifiable elements of archeological material that is not available to scientific approaches”[^70]. Making images of archeological material facilitates a different type of interaction with artefacts. It encourages a different style of looking and seeing[^29], slowing down and focusing engagements with archeological material[^53] and structuring interpretations of the archeological record[^53][^70]. Making images of archeological material allows for an interaction that is distinctly personal, embodied, and intentional[^29][^53] and therefore one which highlights different visual data than traditional recording tools such as photography or photogrammetry[^29].

Image production (as well as storytelling) holds the capacity to engage with time, both in the temporal experience of making, and the ways in which time can be compressed into a single image[^29][^30][^53]. It allows for a more open-ended exploration of personal involvement, intuition, and affective experience[^63], and in doing so, offers a resistive means of knowledge production[^63][^70]. Yet these new and resistive ways knowledge production should not be seen as a replacement for traditional approaches to archeological material. Objective techniques are powerful and valuable in addressing objective questions. Yet these tools prove insufficient to examine the full spectrum of materiality. Instead, more subjective, creative approaches serve as a supplement to the existing approaches in archeology: offering access to new types of data to enrich the archeological record [^5][^70].

# Case Studies

This paper will highlight 3 types of hauntedness that exist along a spectrum of rationality, intentionality, and materiality: possession, aura, and memory. These three types of hauntedness represent an organizational conceit rather than a categorical, exhaustive, or static scheme. After all, one type of materiality does not preclude others – occulted or otherwise[^55]. These three are presented instead to illustrate the diverse ways objects provoke human affectivity and affect human perceptions and actions [^24][^38].

Hauntedness may therefore be quite literal, where objects are possessed by an affecting agent directly. It is an occulted materiality that is most decidedly supernatural[^55], in which ghosts and spirits of the dead act directly upon the living in material ways[^55]. Yet, hauntedness need not be so direct, with objects providing a conduit for aura, or non-living agency. Here, the dead themselves do not act upon the living, but imbue objects with a magical potency to act. Hauntedness may even be figurative, as an object triggers memory and emotion associated with the dead. This type of hauntedness encompasses the idea of spectrality: the spatio-temporal memory of an object, but this affectivity may not be entirely in the control of those in whom emotion and memory is provoked [^30]. Though aspects of hauntedness need not be mutually exclusive, this paper will examine each separately as a case study in exploring hauntedness using creative approaches.

## I. Objects Possessed

The first definition of hauntedness is the most literal: that of possession. Possession here is defined as the belief that an object is inhabited by a non-corporeal agent and imbued with the direct agency of the non-living. Often (though not exclusively) human, these actors are perceived by the senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, or even taste [^3] 580-1; [^2][^44][^49][^75]. A key affordance of these objects is their ability to house and/or facilitate direct encounters with the supernatural in a way that can be physically experienced – and to believers, photographed and measured [^3][^2]. These experiences are the acts of specific agents who – within the metaphysics of hauntedness – exist in the perceivable world [^3].

Belief in ghosts and spirits is hardly antiquated or remote but remains a persistent part of modern life around the world[^11][^44][^55][^75]. In a 2005 Gallup poll, 49% of American adult respondents expressed a belief in ghosts, 39% expressing a belief that places could be haunted, and 22% reporting having lived in a place they believed to be haunted[^3]. Even those who don’t believe in ghosts and spirits recognize the effects that these beliefs have on the material world: even the sedate context of property law recognizes hauntedness as a factor that can affect the resale value of a houses [^69].

       label="Ghost orbs are an element of modern ghost hunting, in which orbs caused by photographic backscatter are interpreted as images of the dead, an effect here reproduced in photoediting software."

Hauntedness is, perhaps unsurprisingly, particularly prevalent within cultural heritage contexts. By far, the dominant representation of archaeological objects in modern cinema is in reference to their supernatural aspects[^32] and the media surrounding ghosts and hauntings has ballooned in recent years [^3]. More recently, the “spinning statuette” at the Manchester Museum was interpreted by the public as a “potential vessel for the spirit of a deceased ancient Egyptian” (among other interpretations). This led to a massive uptick in interest, popularity, speculation, enthusiasm, and museum attendance[^75]. The British Museum has also faced difficulty dispelling ideas of a “mummy’s curse” and malevolent spirits that linger around a 21st or 22nd dynasty mummy in their collection[^48].

       label="A common representation of ghosts and spirits in popular culture is as a dark, out-of-focus figure. Thus, a spectral figure is layered into the background of an archeological model in order to convey the sense that the object is a conduit for the agency of the dead."

Places, too, often become the residence of ghosts and spirits, such as The Historic Cornwall Jail in Cornwall, Ontario, which advertises visitor experiences with hauntings. Visitors, staff, and paranormal investigators attest to both seeing and hearing paranormal actors [^49]. Mariana Lamas and Eduardo Giménez-Cassina outline instances of museum sites and objects that are perceived as haunted or have had paranormal incidents in the past few decades[^44]. So popular is this connection between heritage and possession, that a whole industry of dark tourism and ghost tours has sprung up around those seeking encounters with the dead [^3][^66].

Archaeologists are not immune from experiences with “other-than-human beings”[^67] and ghosts[^2]. In the most literal sense, heritage professionals are often called upon to engage with public experiences of hauntedness[^22][^44][^75]. Yet, on a more personal level, archeologists have been entangled with experiences of hauntedness. The history of archeology is one that is entwined with the spiritualist movement, with some early investigators deploying psychometry, psychics, biometers, and automated writing as part of archaeological research[^2]. Even as these methods fell out of favor in the scientific community, many still espoused beliefs in the occult in their personal life, even as spirits disappeared from publication[^2]. Even now, when the paranormal is publicly denounced as harmful to the discipline[^32], there are still occasional allusions to such experiences among heritage professionals [^44][^49][^67]). Sitting around the sherd bucket at the end of the day, I have heard many a tenured professor tell stories of things falling in storerooms, footsteps in empty hallways, and dark shapes in the night. In those moments of comradery, I might even betray my own moments of supernatural discomfort, quickly dismissed yet nevertheless persistent in my memory. There is clearly something in this experience of hauntedness that resists.

## II. Object Aura

The second definition of hauntedness relates to objects that are imbued with an aura[^31], or magic [^12][^75]. This is the effectual power of an object to evoke a “reverential experience”[^31] – a spiritual “wow” effect[^25]. Perhaps the best definition defines aura as the way in which objects mediate “powerful empathic relationships that seem to transcend place and time”[^31]. Unlike possession, whereby specific agents work directly though objects, this type of haunting describes the way that an object may act as a conduit for the residual or indirect agency of the non-living. This agency lacks the intentionality of direct human action, but nevertheless derives its potency from a human source[^50]. It is an experience that is not so explicitly sensory, such as possession, but is instead a highly affective sensation[^31]. It is the sense that an object has magical agency derived from an association with the dead [^16][^44]. 
<param ve-image 
       label="The concept of aura emerged from the context of Museum Studies in reference to the charisma of an authentic object. This image seeks to explore the aura-producing effect of museum display, by placing the modelled earring within a simplified sketch of the mounting used to display a piece of 'cursed' jewelry, the Hope Diamond on display at the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC." 
       description="The modelled earring was produced in the 3D modelling software Blender 2.93.5 and then layered over a background produced in the photoediting software GIMP 2.10.22."

       url="https://github.com/rosemaryhanson/HansonHauntedTest2/blob/main/Museum%20Case2.png?raw=true"> 

Aura is a long-established concept in Museum Studies as an element of object materiality, drawing from the work of Walter Benjamin [^12][^21][^68]. Yet it is one that is strikingly subjective, contingent, and affective[^12][^31]. It is a quasi-magical potency or charisma to evoke awe and reverence in the viewer[^12][^25]. While the physical properties of an object, such as patina or damage, are relevant to these experiences of awe[^12], the foundations of the auratic experiences lie outside the physical properties[^31], or even the authenticity[^17] of the objects themselves. In that sense, aura is a feeling of entanglement that manifests as a sense of magical agency, charge, or energy[^16][^44]. Yet, despite the subjective bordering on magical aspect of aura, it is an aspect of object materiality that is widely accepted as worthy of study, in part due to its role in legitimizing the museological project[^12]. 
<param ve-image 
       label="In this image, a an English language idiom is translated into a visual image. The auratic experience of objects involves excepting those objects as uniquely important - to put them on a pedestal - and this is an element that can be easily introduced into visualizations without obstructing them." 
       description="The photograph of the earring was taken on a Nikon D3100 Camera, and then edited into a sketch of both earring and pedestal produced in the photoediting software GIMP 2.10.22." 
       license="public domain"
       url="https://github.com/rosemaryhanson/HansonHauntedTest2/blob/main/DoublePedestal.png?raw=true"> 

This concept of object aura is essentially an emotional manifestation of object biography. In the classical object-biographic approach, objects accumulate meaning through their social interactions, with the biography of the object framed by the ways it intersects with the biographies of human beings[^23][^42]. Though post-humanist approaches to objects have challenged this anthropocentric focus[^57][^34], these human entanglements are nevertheless deeply relevant to the auratic potency of objects [^15][^17]. In fact, it is this history of objects that generate this auratic quality which is then substantiated by its material properties[^31]. Objects become powerful in their associations with people, and they retain this power as part of their materiality[^15].
<param ve-image 
       label="In cutural heritage contexts, labels are the primary medium by which objects are denoted as special. Archeological labels and museum labels each tie an object into an object biographical framework - relating the entanglements that seperate an ordinary object from an extrordinary object."

The aura evoked with associations between objects and those that have died can manifest in purely empathic ways: a sense of awe[^12], empathy, dread[^66] closeness to celebrity or charismic authority[^15], morbid fascination[^66], respect[^25], historical authentication[^15][^20] or nostalgia[^6][^15]. This is particularly notable in celebrity possessions and memorabilia, from Theresa Tang’s watches[^20] to tickets to a David Bowie concert[^76], to a Manson family quilt[^15]. Objects act as material nodes in the entanglements between people, in which the charisma of the dead lingers through the objects were associated with.

This aura may also have more practical effects, however, particularly in reference to sacred objects that have been empowered by the influences of important or sacred people [^11][^44]. Objects may possess an aura that is empowered to enact material change such as healing[^13][^16][^18], disaster prevention, luck[^16][^48], or harm [^13][^48]. Steph Berns describes the sacred aura of relics and devotional material that were associated with Catholic saints. She describes this aura in terms of ‘holy radioactivity’ or ‘contact relics’ that exist within the relics and can also pass to personal objects that come in contact with the relics or even the reliquaries that house them[^8]. It is a holiness that stems from the associations with saints and/or saintly remains that make these objects conduits of and surrogates for the presence of non-living saints[^8]. The power of these objects can be potent both in the spiritual and emotional plane, but in the material one as well.

## III. Objects of Memory

A third distinct definition of hauntedness in objects, is when objects are imbued with memory. In these objects, a key material property of an object is the way in which it can evoke memories of the dead. It is therefore a referential agency: these objects are not conduits for the agency of the dead so much as they are surrogates for them[^30]. Within the affective turn, memory is a potent element of object materiality[^38] in which past and present interact, overlap, and disrupt one another [^30]. The biography of such memory objects constitutes a concretion of events, actions, objects, people, memory, time, and emotion into a physical referent[^38][^71]. And while these objects may be a “repository of collective memory” [^19], they may also be a site of “relentless remembering” [^67], that evoke memories involuntarily[^30] as associated neural networks activate one another[^50]. Memory acts through an object, as the biographical associations materialize as a powerful, personal, and emotional experiences of objects.

       label= "Objects, specifically heirlooms, seem to retain associations with people, with the ability to provoke remembering built into their very fabric."
       description="This image was produced from a 3D model produced in the modelling software Blender 2.93.5 and rendered in Eevee. The photo was then imported into the photoediting software GIMP 2.10.22 where it was layered with a photograph of Bea from the collection of Bill and Marge Richie."

In one way or another, all objects act as sites of memory[^51], but some objects have a particular potency in their associations with the dead. Roberta Gilchrist points to heirlooms, particularly as prompts for autobiographical memory. She links them to Mauss’s concept of inalienable objects that absorb the essence of the giver [^19]. In the most literal sense, they reflect the taste of the original owner, extending their material judgements beyond their lifespan[^20]. Yet they may also take the place of the dead, becoming the new site of memory and comfort when the human link is severed[^51]. Not only do they testify to the past [^15], but through this capacity to store and trigger memory[^30][^51] they allow the past to persist and the dead to remain entangled with the living. Thus, they are sites of haunting: not the literal vessels for spirits or conduits for undead power, but as tools through which the dead can be reanimated through the act of remembering. They are tools that allow a return to a time before death[^30], and so keep the dead alive in affective experiences of the present.

It is in this way that Bea’s earring is haunted, and why it seems to stand out against the drab backdrop of my jewelry box: not because it exudes magic or harbors a ghost, but because it is a site of memory. Yet, when I hold this little thing, it feels heavy in my hand, as if infused with the weight of remembering. Somehow, in owning it, I can erase death and decades and reanimate that love that lingers in the shape of her.

Bea is dead, and I know that better than most. From the dispassionate detachment of prolonged excavation experience, I know that she is now a layer of grey ash in the dark, wet soil of a mid-range graveyard. Who knows how many great aunts have come under my trowel; their things bagged up and sent to storeroom basements. I deal in the science of death and loss and things decaying. I know how to measure bones and photograph coffin furniture and draw the little objects left behind. So, I really should know better. Decluttering is the fashion, now, and between moves and cleanouts and therapy sessions centered around my emotional relationship to stuff, I should have disposed of this little piece of kitsch long ago. I should have accepted that death is the end, that “acquits us of all obligations”

But I don’t want to. To throw it away would be “an act of deliberate amnesia”[^51], and I am not yet ready to forget. I do not want to exorcise this ghost from my life but instead I want to remember and in remembering, to keep her here. I want to let this little earring stay unmolested in a drawer until my memory fades and it becomes just glass again.

# Conclusion

The dead haunt us all in different ways: figuratively, literally, or somewhere in between. They mediate our relationships with things: their agencies bursting through the material world in unique disruptions of time and space. It is not our job as archaeologists to capture these ghosts, but to leave space for them. Yet, if we are to tackle these resistive objects, it is vital to engage them in resistive ways: to make art, to tell stories, and to lay bare our own failings in rationality. After all, archaeology does not put the dead to rest but unsettles them, re-vives them, and weaves them back into life. If we are in the business of telling ghost stories, we should at least tell them well.

       label="Objects cast long shadows, both literally and metephorically. These metephorical shadows may be far larger and more evocative than the objects themselves, and are vital to understanding the effects of materiality on our experiences of the world. To represent objects as purely objective packets of materials is to represent them without dimensionality."
