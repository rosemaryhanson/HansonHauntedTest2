This is a story of an earring. 
            
An ugly earring.
           
Cheaply made and cheaply bought, it is meant to resemble a queenly diamond in glass and brass. A large, 3 lobed brown jewel sits beneath a crown of small, round, apricot-colored gems in a color palette that now seems a stereotype of the 1970s. These faux diamonds have been haphazardly set into a thin, metal clip that pinches and weighs the ear unpleasantly. It was presumably once part of a pair, but its twin has long ago been lost in the back of a drawer of a relative or the case of a second-hand shop or (most likely) underneath 200ft of West Seattle landfill. It is, without doubt, an object out of place. I keep it in my jewelry drawer, but I have no intention of wearing it. It has no functionalist, aesthetic, or rational role in my life and there is really no reason that I should keep it.
            
Yet, I cling to it: not for what it is, or what it was, or what it could be; not for its value, not for its beauty, not for the hope that I may someday wear it. I cling to it because it was hers: the property of a great aunt, Bea, now dead. I keep it because it is full of memories: the memory of childhood visits and the smell of old perfume and hospital disinfectant. The memory of a sombre distribution that I did not understand, and a jewellery box that I was too small to carry. The memory of a quiet presence, felt on the back of the neck in the superstitious hours. The memory of death and life and loss and obligation and the first thing I ever owned that glittered. 
            
In my archaeological education, I have spent a great deal of time exploring the properties of materials. I have tried to make sense of object materiality through measurement, weight, form, wear, illustration, reconstruction, sound, smell, heft, and feel. Yet in this lump of ugly brown glass, none of these really matter. Instead, I cannot relinquish it (though I might wish to) because it is imbued with a secret materiality that exists in my mind alone. I understand and interact with this object because it is haunted: by memory, by superstition, and by a link that still connects me to a woman decades dead. 
            
Bea, somehow, has made this object different.

# More than the Sum of its Parts

This is the story of a material property that isn’t. It is not visible, it is not quantifiable, it isn’t even material. And yet, it is experienced (sometimes quite powerfully), and it has effects (sometimes quite dramatic) (Mukharji 2018, 35). It is the sense that objects are haunted: somehow changed by the persisting agency of the dead; by an intrusion of those gone onto the living experience of the material world, both literally and figuratively. Yet, however potent the effects may be, experiences of hauntedness are still highly personal, subjective, and individual and thus elude the project of objective realism that underpins grounded archeological study. By its affective nature, hauntedness is a sensory experience that cannot be measured, replicated, or recorded, and this makes its study resistive to traditional methods. Yet archeology is uniquely positioned to engage with these points of overlap between the objective and subjective: straddling the sciences, humanities, and social sciences. So, instead of resisting this intersection of objectivity and subjectivity, this paper seeks to engage with it directly: interweaving narrative, image production, and analysis to explore hauntedness as a property of objects. In doing so, I hope not only to define and validate hauntedness as an important aspect of object materiality, but also to encourage creative approaches to the complex, resistive, often immaterial materiality of objects.

# Hauntedness as a Material Property of Objects

To ask whether hauntedness is real is to ask the wrong question. The afterlife is a topic for philosophers, theologians, neuroscientists, and metaphysicians - and so I leave it to them. Instead, this paper approaches hauntedness through the lens of Material Culture Studies, in which material identities are co-constituted in the relationships between people and objects (Holtorf 2002, 49; Ingold 2007, 1; Webmoor and Witmore 2008, 58). Physical attributes and social attributes both converge in the perception of the world and reality is constructed on this intersection (Gilchrist 2013, 171; Hamilakis & Jones 2017, 81; Holtorf 2002, 49; Mukharji 2018, 33). Within this frame, it doesn’t matter if the dead actually linger on the material plane. If reality is constructed around a metaphysics that includes hauntedness as a material property of the world, then individuals will interact with that world in reference to hauntedness (Herva et al 2010, 609). As such, it is real enough. The mind is not so neatly separated from the body (Lucas 2012, 41; Simandiraki-Grimshaw 2012, 254); placebos, after all, can still heal the sick (Benedetti 2009). 

Hauntedness is therefore a subjective property of object materiality. It is a property in which the dead imbue matter with agency. This agency may be physical (Baker & Bader 2014, 580-1), magical (Herva et al 2010, 610; Mukharji 2018, 33; Zuanni & Price 2018, 235), and/or emotional (Hill 2013, 380; Ireland & Lydon 2016, 3), but it is a power that emerges from biographical associations between people and things (Holotorf 2002, 49; Joy 2009, 552). It is a persistence of entanglement between the dead, the living, and material objects in a panoply of configurations across time and space (Hill 2013, 379; Webmoor and Witmore 2008, 56).
            
In this sense, haunted objects are a prime example of mixtures (Webmoor and Witmore 2008, 59) or bundles (Bauer & Kosiba 2016, 119). They are both subject and object, human and nonhuman, real and unreal, effected by and effecting human consciousness, and full of contradictions and bifurcations (Webmoor and Witmore 2008, 59-60). They make the social physical and the physical social (Bauer & Kosiba 2016, 119), entangling, mixing, and distributing human consciousness and object materiality (Hodder 2011, 163). They compress and distort time and disrupt the neat separation of past, present, and future (Hills 2013, 381; Supernant 2020, 86). 
            
It is precisely because haunted objects offer such a rich and complex materiality that they are useful for engaging archaeological theory. They provide an example of object agency derived from human subjects, yet at varying levels of perceived intentionality (Bauer & Kosiba 2016, 117; Webmoor and Witmore 2008, 59-60). They are vibrant matter, but it is a vibrancy that primarily springs from supernatural or affective sources as opposed to the materials of the objects themselves (Ingold 2007, 11; Mukharji 2018, 34). They are entangled, not only in “webs of life” (Ingold 2012, 428), but webs beyond life, where the dead remain entangled in the world (Young & Light 2012, 138) through their objects. Objects become links in a chain to nothing that nevertheless still hold the shape of that enchainment like a phantom limb (Bauer & Kosiba 2016, 117; Hamilakis & Jones 2017, 81). Perhaps most fascinatingly, this resistant materiality can have a material expression. Haunted objects may evoke a sensory experiences that are both powerfully perceived and culturally constituted (Baker & Bader 2014, 540; Barber 2016, 12; Lamas & Giménez-Cassina 2012, 79-80; Luscombe et al. 2017, 448), complicating the frame of what constitute sensory approaches in archaeology. 
            
Yet for all that these objects can enrich explorations of object materiality, they exist on the fringe of archaeology. They are, after all, superstitious objects, displaying a materiality that exists outside the natural sciences and the objective goals of processual archaeology (Burke et al 2015, 46; Gilchrist 2018, 119). Haunted objects appear to embody a form of “magical” thinking that is seen as decidedly unmodern, unenlightened, uneducated, and irrational (Barber 2016, 17; Mukharji 2018, 33; Herva et al 2010, 613; Zuanni & Price 2018, 249). Hauntedness, along with magic, folklore, and superstition are therefore relegated to the outskirts of the discipline (Dowd 2017, 451; Gilchrist 2018, 119), or worse still, left to the purview of pseudo-archaeology in its hunt for ghosts, curses, aliens, and monsters (Bond 2018; Hiscock 2012, 157; Zuanni & Price 2018, 246). Moreover, explorations of hauntedness might appear to skirt the symbolic and psychoanalytic approaches of post-processualism, focusing on the meaning of things (Ingold 2012, 428; Ireland & Lydon 2016, 2); a particularly fraught project when no resources are available for emic analysis (Burke et al 2015, 69).
            
This paper does not seek to embark on such a project of meaning making (much less a project of ghost hunting). This paper instead seeks to recognize hauntedness as part of the “murk[y] middle ground” in explorations of folk ritual beliefs (Burke et al 2015, 69). It is a sphere of causality that exists in tandem with objective causality (Mukharji 2018). By dismissing it, we may “build false assumptions about what the ‘real world’ is like” (Herva et al 2010, 609), secularizing, rationalizing, and suppressing the often powerful effects of heritage (Butler 2016, 113-117; Mukharji 2018, 32). As we collect a library of sensory experience through which to examine objects (Harris 2014; Harris 2020, 213; Hurcombe 2007, 538-40), a focus on the physical senses alone may well be inconsistent with the ontologies that framed (and frame) the experience of the material world (Butler 2016, 232; Herva et al 2010, 611). In failing to recognize that sensory experiences may be informed by these deep spiritual, cultural frameworks, we are doomed to an idea of sensitivity that is sanitized and one-dimensional. 
            
In failing to recognize these relational frameworks, my own experience of a haunted object simply does not exist.  

# Humanist Problems Require Creative Solutions

In exploring hauntedness as an immaterial material property of objects, tools for quantification are clearly inappropriate. Indeed, attempts to measure and record evidence of ghosts and spirits quickly diverge into the realms of ghost hunting (Baker & Bader 2014, 580), spiritualism (Barber 2016, 10-13), and pseudo-archeology (Bond 2018; Hiscock 2012, 156). Instead, subjective questions require a more subjective toolkit: one that engages this subjectivity, as opposed to resisting or obscuring it (Watterson 2015, 125). This paper deploys two such tools to explore hauntedness as a material property of objects. The first is auto-ethnographic storytelling (Baker & Bader 569; Hill 2013, 382; Ireland & Lydon 2016, 4), and the second is visual artistic practice (Glazier 2005, 170; Hill 2013, 386; Watterson 2015, 119). In doing so, I seek to demonstrate the ways that creative practice can be deployed to enrich more traditional forms of analysis.

Drawing from anthropology, the use of auto-ethnographic storytelling is quite commonplace in the discipline, and has been very effectively deployed to explore affective aspects of memory (Hill 2013, 379; Kennedy 2006, v), ruination (Pétursdótter 2012), materials (Holtorf 2002; Ingold 2007, 1), etc. This mode of engagement is particularly appropriate in relationship to haunting, as first-hand accounts of haunting experience are a key element of ghost belief (Baker & Bader 2014, 584). Moreover, ghosts and hauntings frequently appear as a conceptual metaphor in heritage study in reference to things that are abandoned, concealed, or suppressed (Barber 2016, 18). In the logocentric context of professional academia (James 2011, 24), auto-ethnographic storytelling is the logical creative extension for archeological analysis, but this reflexivity is hardly the exclusive remit of the written word.
            
Image production offers a different form of storytelling, but one in which the discipline is far less comfortable (Watterson 2015, 122). Though social sciences, and particularly anthropology, have begun experimenting with new visual modes of engagement (Heath et al 2018, 713-4), images are often still treated with suspicion or hostility (Morgan & Wright 2018, 136; Watterson 2015, 121). Though a visually rich discipline (Smiles & Moser 2005, 3; Watterson 2015, 119) exposed to an increasingly rich visual media landscape (Russell 2006, 8-9), archeology often struggles with visual literacy (Hiscock 2012, 162; James 2011, 33; Perry 2009, 391; Smiles 2005, 152; Watterson 2015, 120). There are fears that images are overly subjective in production (Molyneoux 1997, 5), interpretively unstable (James 2011, 33; Watterson 2015, 119; Russell 2006, 9), and able to achieve a false sense of authority, concealing nefarious theoretical or political intentions behind pleasant aesthetics (Hiscock 2012, 173; James 2011, 26; Morgan & Wright 2018, 138; Moser 2014, 60; Molyneoux 2011, 4). If the visual is associated with the real and objective (Mukharji 2018, 33) and archeological images are expected to present authoritative and accurate depictions of the world (Watterson 2015, 127) any deviance from realism is a necessarily a betrayal of truth. 
            
These fears are not unfounded, but stem from a foundational naiveté around what images can and can’t do (Watterson 2015, 122). Images cannot be perfect, objective representations of an object (Moser & Smiles 2005, 2) Images and image-making are culturally, socially, and perceptually relative (Molyneoux 1997, 4), not to mention dependent on the skill, knowledge, and experience of the artist (Moser & Smiles 2005, 3). Moreover, viewers will apply their own prejudices as they interpret art (James 2011, 33; Watterson 2015, 119) and these will change and shift over time and context (Russell 2006, 9). And images cannot be innocent: they have agendas as part of their raison d’etre (Molyneoux 1997, 4; Smiles & Moser 2005, 1). 
            
Yet each of these concerns can equally be levied at the written word: written analysis of objects is culturally contingent (Holtorf 2002, 49; Yarrow 2003, 65), words are frequently misinterpreted by audiences (Zuanni & Price 2018, 239), and articles are published with explicit theoretical (and implicit political) agendas. The difference here is simply one of literacy: archeologists are comfortable in textual analysis, but not in visual analysis (Hiscock 2012, 162; Perry 2009, 391). Furthermore, these concerns over images are not without their paternalistic undertones. Images are widely popular and accessible – often more so than words (Hiscock 2012, 256; Russell 2006, 11). If even children can see and comprehend an image (Heath et al 2018, 725; James 2011, 24), how then can the public be trusted to come to the “correct” conclusions?
            
Yet it is because of this very subjectivity that images can be useful to engage with more culturally contingent questions. Images facilitate the “ability to explore subjective, problematic, personal, empathic, emotional and un-quantifiable elements of archeological material that is not available to scientific approaches” (Watterson 2015, 122). Making images of archeological material facilitates a different type of interaction with artefacts. It encourages a different style of looking and seeing (Heath et al 2018, 722-3), slowing down and focusing engagements with archeological material (Morgan & Wright 2018, 148) and structuring interpretations of the archeological record (Morgan & Wright 2018, 137; Watterson 2015, 121). Making images of archeological material allows for an interaction that is distinctly personal, embodied, and intentional (Heath et al 2018, 715; Morgan & Wright 2018, 137-146) and therefore one which highlights different visual data than traditional recording tools such as photography or photogrammetry (Heath et al 2018, 726). 
            
Image production (as well as storytelling) holds the capacity to engage with time, both in the temporal experience of making, and the ways in which time can be compressed into a single image (Heath et al 2018, 720; Hill 2013, 380; Morgan & Wright 2018, 139). It allows for a more open-ended exploration of personal involvement, intuition, and affective experience (Smiles 2005, 153), and in doing so, offers a resistive means of knowledge production (Smiles 2005, 148; Watterson 2015, 121). Yet these new and resistive ways knowledge production should not be seen as a replacement for traditional approaches to archeological material. Objective techniques are powerful and valuable in addressing objective questions. Yet these tools prove insufficient to examine the full spectrum of materiality. Instead, more subjective, creative approaches serve as a supplement to the existing approaches in archeology: offering access to new types of data to enrich the archeological record (Batemen 2005, 193; Watterson 2015, 125). 

# Case Studies

This paper will highlight 3 types of hauntedness that exist along a spectrum of rationality, intentionality, and materiality: possession, aura, and memory. These three types of hauntedness represent an organizational conceit rather than a categorical, exhaustive, or static scheme. After all, one type of materiality does not preclude others – occulted or otherwise (Mukharji 2018, 38). These three are presented instead to illustrate the diverse ways objects provoke human affectivity and affect human perceptions and actions (Hamilakis & Jones 2017, 82; Ireland & Lydon 2016, 4). 

Hauntedness may therefore be quite literal, where objects are possessed by an affecting agent directly. It is an occulted materiality that is most decidedly supernatural (Mukharji 2011, 35-7), in which ghosts and spirits of the dead act directly upon the living in material ways (Mukharji 2018, 37). Yet, hauntedness need not be so direct, with objects providing a conduit for aura, or non-living agency. Here, the dead themselves do not act upon the living, but imbue objects with a magical potency to act. Hauntedness may even be figurative, as an object triggers memory and emotion associated with the dead. This type of hauntedness encompasses the idea of spectrality: the spatio-temporal memory of an object (Hill 2013, 381), but this affectivity may not be entirely in the control of those in whom emotion and memory is provoked (Hill 2013, 381). Though aspects of hauntedness need not be mutually exclusive, this paper will examine each separately as a case study in exploring hauntedness using creative approaches. 

## I. Objects Possessed

The first definition of hauntedness is the most literal: that of possession. Possession here is defined as the belief that an object is inhabited by a non-corporeal agent and imbued with the direct agency of the non-living. Often (though not exclusively) human, these actors are perceived by the senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, or even taste (Baker & Bader 2014, 580-1; Barber 2016, 12; Lamas & Giménez-Cassina 2012, 79-80; Luscombe et al. 2017, 448; Zuanni & Price 2018, 240). A key affordance of these objects is their ability to house and/or facilitate direct encounters with the supernatural in a way that can be physically experienced – and to believers, photographed and measured (Baker & Bader 2014, 580-2; Barber 2016, 12). These experiences are the acts of specific agents who – within the metaphysics of hauntedness – exist in the perceivable world (Baker & Bader 2014, 584). 

Belief in ghosts and spirits is hardly antiquated or remote but remains a persistent part of modern life around the world (Butler 2016, 118; Lamas & Gimenéz-Cassina 2012, 84-85; Mukharji 2018; Zuanni & Price 2018). In a 2005 Gallup poll, 49% of American adult respondents expressed a belief in ghosts, 39% expressing a belief that places could be haunted, and 22% reporting having lived in a place they believed to be haunted (Baker & Bader 2014, 572). Even those who don’t believe in ghosts and spirits recognize the effects that these beliefs have on the material world: even the sedate context of property law recognizes hauntedness as a factor that can affect the resale value of a houses (Warner 1993, 208). 

Hauntedness is, perhaps unsurprisingly, particularly prevalent within cultural heritage contexts. By far, the dominant representation of archaeological objects in modern cinema is in reference to their supernatural aspects (Hiscock 2012, 156) and the media surrounding ghosts and hauntings has ballooned in recent years (Baker & Bader 2014, 570). More recently, the “spinning statuette” at the Manchester Museum was interpreted by the public as a “potential vessel for the spirit of a deceased ancient Egyptian” (among other interpretations) (Zuanni & Price 2018, 239). This led to a massive uptick in interest, popularity, speculation, enthusiasm, and museum attendance (Zuanni & Price 2018, 240). The British Museum has also faced difficulty dispelling ideas of a “mummy’s curse” and malevolent spirits that linger around a 21st or 22nd dynasty mummy in their collection (Luckhurst 2012). 

Places, too, often become the residence of ghosts and spirits, such as The Historic Cornwall Jail in Cornwall, Ontario, which advertises visitor experiences with hauntings. Visitors, staff, and paranormal investigators attest to both seeing and hearing paranormal actors (Luscombe et al. 2017, 448). Mariana Lamas and Eduardo Giménez-Cassina outline instances of museum sites and objects that are perceived as haunted or have had paranormal incidents in the past few decades (2012). So popular is this connection between heritage and possession, that a whole industry of dark tourism and ghost tours has sprung up around those seeking encounters with the dead (Baker & Bader 2014, 579; Stone and Sharpley 2008, 578).

Archaeologists are not immune from experiences with “other-than-human beings” (Supernant 2020, 86) and ghosts (Barber 2016, 13). In the most literal sense, heritage professionals are often called upon to engage with public experiences of hauntedness (Glazier 2005, 170; Lamas & Gimenéz-Cassina 2012, 77; Zuanni & Price 2018, 329). Yet, on a more personal level, archeologists have been entangled with experiences of hauntedness. The history of archeology is one that is entwined with the spiritualist movement, with some early investigators deploying psychometry, psychics, biometers, and automated writing as part of archaeological research (Barber 2016, 12-13). Even as these methods fell out of favor in the scientific community, many still espoused beliefs in the occult in their personal life, even as spirits disappeared from publication (Barber 2016, 14). Even now, when the paranormal is publicly denounced as harmful to the discipline (Hiscock 2012, 157), there are still occasional allusions to such experiences among heritage professionals (Lamas & Giménez-Cassina 2012, 79-80; Luscombe et al. 2017, 448; Supernant 2020, 86). Sitting around the sherd bucket at the end of the day, I have heard many a tenured professor tell stories of things falling in storerooms, footsteps in empty hallways, and dark shapes in the night. In those moments of comradery, I might even betray my own moments of supernatural discomfort, quickly dismissed yet nevertheless persistent in my memory. There is clearly something in this experience of hauntedness that resists.

### Visualizing Possession

Because these are hauntings in the most literal sense, they are the easiest to visualize; there is a rich tradition of artistic representations of ghostly spectres that can be drawn from to render the immaterial into a familiar image. The classic “bedsheet” ghost that originated from the funerary practices of the European Middle Ages (Davies 2007) is a now ubiquitous cliché of hauntedness. As such, it can act as a visual shorthand for hauntedness, such as the renderings of Egyptian Shaitan added to images of Egyptian archaeology (Glazier 2005, 170) or the ‘ghost orbs’ photographed by American paranormal investigators (Baker & Bader 2014, 580). Transparent figures are another familiar visual convention which emerged in the 18th and 19th century (Owens 2017). This conceit allows for the inclusion of any number of limbs or figures with the clear recognition of their phantasmagorical character. Yet this visual invocation of hauntedness need not be so explicit. Reflecting an image off the glass of the earring can more subtly allude to a sense of presence.  

## II. Object Aura

The second definition of hauntedness relates to objects that are imbued with an aura (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 1), or magic (Cameron 2007, 7; Zuanni & Price 2018, 244). This is the effectual power of an object to evoke a “reverential experience” (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 10) – a spiritual “wow” effect (Hamp & Schwan 2014, 360). Perhaps the best definition defines aura as the way in which objects mediate “powerful empathic relationships that seem to transcend place and time” (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 11). Unlike possession, whereby specific agents work directly though objects, this type of haunting describes the way that an object may act as a conduit for the residual or indirect agency of the non-living. This agency lacks the intentionality of direct human action, but nevertheless derives its potency from a human source (McGraw & Krátsky 2017, 241). It is an experience that is not so explicitly sensory, such as possession, but is instead a highly affective sensation (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 1). It is the sense that an object has magical agency derived from an association with the dead (Dowd 2017, 467; Lamas & Giménez-Cassina 2012, 81). 

Aura is a long-established concept in Museum Studies as an element of object materiality, drawing from the work of Walter Benjamin (Cameron 2007, 11; Gillings 2005, 230; Walsh 2007, 9). Yet it is one that is strikingly subjective, contingent, and affective (Cameron 2007, 7; Hindmarch et al. 2019, 11). It is a quasi-magical potency or charisma to evoke awe and reverence in the viewer (Cameron 2007, 7; Hampp & Schwan 2014, 360). While the physical properties of an object, such as patina or damage, are relevant to these experiences of awe (Cameron 2007, 11), the foundations of the auratic experiences lie outside the physical properties (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 11), or even the authenticity (Foster & Curtis 2014, 140) of the objects themselves. In that sense, aura is a feeling of entanglement that manifests as a sense of magical agency, charge, or energy (Dowd 2017, 467; Lamas & Giménez-Cassina 2012, 81). Yet, despite the subjective bordering on magical aspect of aura, it is an aspect of object materiality that is widely accepted as worthy of study, in part due to its role in legitimizing the museological project (Cameron 2007, 3-4). 

This concept of object aura is essentially an emotional manifestation of object biography. In the classical object-biographic approach, objects accumulate meaning through their social interactions, with the biography of the object framed by the ways it intersects with the biographies of human beings (Godson & Marshall 1999, 170-4; Joy 2009, 540). Though post-humanist approaches to objects have challenged this anthropocentric focus (Nativ 2014, 180; Holtorf 2002, 49), these human entanglements are nevertheless deeply relevant to the auratic potency of objects (Denham 2020, 343; Foster & Curtis 2016, 138).  In fact, it is this history of objects that generate this auratic quality which is then substantiated by its material properties (Hindmarch et al. 2019, 11). Objects become powerful in their associations with people, and they retain this power as part of their materiality (Denham 2020, 343).

The aura evoked with associations between objects and those that have died can manifest in purely empathic ways: a sense of awe (Cameron 2007, 11), empathy (Stone & Sharpley 2008, 579), dread (Stone & Sharpley 2008, 581) closeness to celebrity or charismic authority (Denham 2020, 334), morbid fascination (Stone & Sharpley 2008, 584),  respect (Hampp & Schwan  2014, 360) historical authentication (Denham 2020, 342; Gilks 2016, 221) or nostalgia (Belk 1988, 551; Denham 2020, 344). This is particularly notable in celebrity possessions and memorabilia, from Theresa Tang’s watches (Gilks 2016, 222) to tickets to a David Bowie concert (Redmond 2017, 6), to a Manson family quilt (Denham 2020, 336). Objects act as material nodes in the entanglements between people, in which the charisma of the dead lingers through the objects were associated with.

This aura may also have more practical effects, however, particularly in reference to sacred objects that have been empowered by the influences of important or sacred people (Butler 2016, 115; Lamas & Giménez-Cassin 2012, 81). Objects may possess an aura that is empowered to enact material change such as healing (Cleaver 2014, 57; Dowd 2018, 460; Gilchrist 2008, 126), disaster prevention (Dowd 2018, 451), luck (Dowd 2018, 458; Luckhurst 2012, 258), or harm (Cleaver 2014, 53; Luckhurst 2012, 258). Steph Berns describes the sacred aura of relics and devotional material that were associated with Catholic saints. She describes this aura in terms of ‘holy radioactivity’ or ‘contact relics’ that exist within the relics and can also pass to personal objects that come in contact with the relics or even the reliquaries that house them (Berns 2015, 158-9). It is a holiness that stems from the associations with saints and/or saintly remains that make these objects conduits of and surrogates for the presence of non-living saints (Berns 2015, 165). The power of these objects can be potent both in the spiritual and emotional plane, but in the material one as well.

dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the
